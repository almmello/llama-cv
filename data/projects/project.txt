1. The first 5G industrial private network in Latin America in the port sector  
**Company:** TIM S/A  
**Period:** Oct 2020 - Present  
**Description:** BTP - Brasil Terminal Portuário hired TIM Brasil and Nokia to install the port sector's first 5G industrial private network in Latin America. Handling 2 million TEUs per year (equivalent to a 6-meter container), BTP - Brasil Terminal Portuário is one of the largest container terminals in the Port of Santos. The company is a joint venture between APM Terminals and Terminal Investment Limited (TIL), leaders in the world container market, belonging to the two largest global shipping groups — Maersk Group and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, respectively.  
I worked as the product manager for this project, which involved the installation of a 5G network to support the terminal's operations; This project was complex since it involved deploying new technology in a highly regulated environment. As a result, we had to coordinate the efforts of multiple internal and external teams to ensure the project's success.  
Using a separate, dedicated 3.5 GHz TIM Brasil's frequency with a unique network Core, the 5G low latency, high speed, and capacity allow applications, such as smart cameras, installed in the terminal to monitor real-time container's movements.  
Additionally, TIM Brasil will improve the 4G network in the immediate vicinity to provide better coverage to all workers at the terminal.  
The technology will bring operational improvements like time reductions in loading ships and cargo, energy efficiency, and safety, increasing BTP's productivity and logistical effectiveness.  
1. React Calculator  
**Company:** DIO  
**Period:** Oct 2022 - Nov 2022  
**Description:** This project was bootstrapped with Create React App (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and used the Styled Components library.  
I started with a working calculator with limited operations; only addition and subtraction were present in the startup code.  
**My contributions:** I did a new design with my color pallet and styles.  
The Calculator can hold the number when we press the operation symbol.  
The equal sign creates a continuous operation loop.  
After an operation, if we type another operation sign, the Calculator performs another calculation indefinitely.  
I introduced new operations and used BigNumbers to fix the precision issue on decimal calculations.

1. Casting Agency  
**Company:** Udacity  
**Period:** Sep 2022 - Sep 2022  
**Description:** A new digitally enabled Casting Agency for Producers and Directors to manage Actors and Movies.  
I used SQLAlchemy to define models and data types with helper methods like creating, inserting, updating, and deleting to serialize the data model and simplify API behavior.  
I followed RESTful principles of API development, including appropriate naming of endpoints, with HTTP methods GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE. The routes perform CRUD operations.  
I enable Role Based Authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) in a Flask application using Auth0.  
I provided all instructions to host the project on Heroku.

**Company:** Udacity  
**Period:** Jul 2022 - Aug 2022

**Description:** Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and booking of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as venue owners.  
I connected the app to the Flask backend and the PostgreSQL database. Then, I implemented the controllers for listing venues, artists, and shows and the form submissions for creating new Venues, Artists, and Shows.  
To set up normalized models for the objects we support in our web app, I used SQLAlchemy and all the learned best practices in database schema design.  
Finally, I implemented the missing model properties and relationships using database migrations via Flask-Migrate.
